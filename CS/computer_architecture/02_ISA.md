## Instruction Set Architecture(ISA)

### Machine Language

* Programming language
  * High-level programming languages
    * Procedual(절차적) languages: C, PASCAL, FORTRAN
    * Object-Oriented languages: C++, Java, ...
    * Functional languages: Lisp, Scheme
  * Assembly programming languages: symbolic machine languages
  * Machine languages: binary, IA32, IA64, ARM
* Translator
  * Compiler: translate a high-level language -> machine language
  * Assembler: assembly language -> machine language
  * Interpreter: translate and excute programs directly
    * JVM: translate/execute Java bytecode to native machine instructions



### Compiler

* Compiler
  * A program that translates a source program -> a target program
  * Source program
    * Usually written in high-level programmin languages such as C, C++, Java, Python, ...
  * Target program
    * Usually written in machine languages such as x86, Alpha, MIPS, ARM instructions, ...
* What qualities do you want in a compiler?
  * Generate correct code
    * 정확한 번역
  * Target codes run fast
    * 코드 최적화
  * Compiler runs fast
    * 컴파일 눌렀을 때 바로 바로
  * Support for separate compilation, good diagnostics for errors



### Compile Process

* 그림 그리기
